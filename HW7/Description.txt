HW7 -> Do It Yourself Hashtables
November 2017

Since the number of unique words was about 13894, I decided to use a load factor of .75

So; 13894/M = 2.50 therefore M, the size of the hash table, was rounded up to be 5558.
However since it is not prime, the next prime number will be 5563. So this will be the array size for "HW5.txt".

The hashing function will be using the mod function so it will take the ASCII as an int and will perform % 5563. 

For part two, I chose 12000 as the initial size and 75% as the initial fill ratio. I chose 1000 because the hash table would have to resize itself in order to work with the default .75 fill ratio.
